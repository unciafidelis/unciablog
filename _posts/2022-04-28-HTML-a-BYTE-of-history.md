**BIT-1**: HTML brings a powerful tool to create and interact with any website; every developer in the world must undestand the concepts behind this technology that is live for over 40 years.

**BIT-2**: The first intent of hipertext protocols includes a really complex set of instructions to share and interact with files, as Tim Berners-Lee proposed in the 80's. This hipertext protocols developed, could only be handled by experts of those years as it was hard to understand or even to get access to this tools.

**BIT-3**: After a few years, Tim joined forces with a Systems Engineer named Robert Cailliau, they present one of the most hystoric proposals in the world: the World Wide Web (www).

**BIT-4**: This new tool needed a lot of work and as it was said before, the primitive system to develop hypertext was complex and hard to understand, the developers needed once again, to improve a tool that they created, bringing to life the TAGS in the 90's.

**BIT-5**: After defining 2 standards HTML and HTML+ where the new structures innovate the way to create a website (Tables, Forms and images) The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 1995 accomplished to publish the standard of HTML 2.0 the first official standart of HTML in the world.

**BIT-6**: HTML 3 was all around JAVA applets and fluent text around images. HTML 4 was just a series of reviews that wasn't significant.

**BIT-7**: With the creation of the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) by the enterprises Apple, Mozilla and Opera, showing concern of the low interest that the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) had around HTML. 

**BIT-8**: HTML 5 first draft was published in 2008 and at this point the W3C was decided to retake activities on the HTML standarization, been since 2008 the standard HyperText Markup Language most used in the world.
